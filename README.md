# Correlation-in-Python

Dataset used: 
[Movies Dataset.csv](https://github.com/NaFatimata/Correlation-in-Python/files/7524408/Movies.Dataset.csv)

In this project, I used Python lybraries (Panda, Numpy, Seaborn) to find correlations between the Movies Dataset's variables. Finding correlations helps make accurate predictions.
